# Binary Trees

This project explores the concept of binary trees and related data structures and algorithms.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Explain what a binary tree is and its basic properties.
- Differentiate between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree (BST).
- Understand the potential advantages of using binary trees in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists.
- Define the depth, height, and size of a binary tree and understand their significance.
- Describe different traversal methods used to navigate through a binary tree.
- Define and understand the characteristics of complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary trees.

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Files compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should follow the Betty style guide
- Avoid using global variables
- Limit functions per file to no more than 5
- Allowed to use the standard library
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file `binary_trees.h`
- Header files should be include guarded
